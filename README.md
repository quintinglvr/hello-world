# hello-world

Hey, I'm Josh.

21 years old. I consider myself as a young adult, yet I'm still effin clueless as to what I want in this world. Some days I dream of big things, while some days I'm as down as the deepest sewer in the world. The things I do, sometimes I do them because they're fun, but most of the times I do them because they're what others want me to do, or what looks normal. I'm afraid of standing out. As an introvert, you understand that being the center of attention is a survival threat for us.

And the list goes on and on. It's a long list, but I'll cut it short as this is just an exercise lmao
